#### Budget calculator app created for javascript course.

The objective of the app was to learn the basics of DOM manipulation.

The app currently canâ€™t store the user data after page refresh.

### Extra implementations, not required in the course: 
- Labels for each incomes or expense
- Filters by label
- Sum of filtered incomes/expenses

### Future implementatios:
- Back-end to store user data and make the app fully functional.
